 RNAâ€“protein interactions (RPIs) drive central post-transcriptional processes such as splicing, translation, and RNA turnover, yet systematic experimental mapping of RPIs remains costly and incomplete. This project investigates computational prediction of RPIs
 with an emphasis on practical, resource-efficient methods. We focus on two tasks: (i) pairwise interaction prediction, i.e., given an RNA and a protein, decide whether they interact; and (ii) RNA-binding protein (RBP) identification, i.e., determine from sequence alone
 whether a protein is capable of binding RNA.
